CURRENT WEEK
-------

- CoC Issue :

The current CoC clause "Using and promotion use of gender neutral pronouns" *encourages* members to use neutral pronouns.
No one in the past has been blocked but rather educated in right way when not using the neutral pronouns, so in the interest of community,
we don't see a need to remove this clause from the CoC as of now, though we definitely can encourage the members to put their preffered pronouns
in their TG bio, so anyone addressing them can refer that before hand, but when addressing a wider audience / entire group we still recommend using gender
neutral pronouns, refer- https://heyguys.cc to know more ...
