    * Boot ARM OS on qemu | Qemu 101 (Ayan)
    * KiCad 101 but with a STM32 example (Mason)
    * RE (Ayan & Xeon)
      - HW
      - SW
    * Board Bringup (Ayan & Xeon)

3. CTF
    * Solving an old ques but dont think that i'll be able to solve it (Mason)

4. Chaos Engg Online Version

5. Gaming Nights/Days/Afternoons/Evenings/LateNights
    * Scribble
  
6. Moderated Panel Discussion

    * Data Privacy and Security
    * How coding should be taught to kids / students (Kishore)
    * Bootstrapping your career (Ayan & Xeon)

### More Ideas?

* What about some research paper talks, where the author reads some paper and explains the overarching concepts of some research paper. (Kishore)
  - The audience should read the paper once before attending so it'll be easy to understand and they'll be able to ask
    relevant queries.
* Ricing phone/pc/washingmachine/whatever (Xeon)
* IDE Power Usage (Kishore & Ayan)
