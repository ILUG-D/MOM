### What is being proposed for future?
- We go ahead with a really old idea of holding a linux conf. Previously it was meant to be hosted offline but oh thanks to covid we will be hosting it online.
- Ayan gave an example of makerville which happend a while back which was hosted on youtube and the stream manager used was "streamyard".

### The flaky plan
- CFP (?)
  - (Hellozee) cons being that its time consuming. More than a month.
- (ayan) Lightning sessions (from community) and 1hr sessions
- (grlwholifts) hiring and pitching sessions in between
- (ayan) discord server to manage this whole plethora?
- (grlwholifts) the thing pycon did. Companies running parallel sessions?
  - everyone disagrees
- donation basis or ticketing system? 50 INR per ticket?
  - (alok) server costs are not that high. even if we take for 2 days it wont cost much.
  - mostly people opposing ticketing system
- (grlwholifts) ILUGD merch stalls at the end of this conf (?)
  - no response from anyone
- (hellozee) put a poll
  - length of conf (3+1(break))
  - when we host this conf
  - (ayan) 1/2 hr talks each and <4 hours
  - others agrees for putting a poll on telegram group
- (ayan) we can ask potential speakers to open an issue.
- (ayan) core linux (not entirely FOSS/py/prog)
  - others agree with core linux theme
- Arjoon is happy that he can finally propose his lambda talk
