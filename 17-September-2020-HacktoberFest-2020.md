      examples without explaining what that command does.

      this video while writing script for video. Will help
      in data structure part.

      brief while writing syntax.
    - Making an example code. (LED blinking)
    - and then explaining what your code exactly did.
    - reading documentation bcz every single detail is there.
    - making a simple project.. maybe something from nk521/cktpy
    - one more example (maybe)
    - Interacting and debugging using console.
    - Ask the chat to make some projects using cktpy simulator
      no matter how many lines of code you write. if it works
      at the end then just make a PR.
