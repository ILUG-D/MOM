Mason explains the hacktoberfest plan.
  - We can use circuitpython playgorund simulator to teach the target audience basics of
  programming and whatever projects they make using that simulator can be merged into a
  repo.

Comments from others : 
  - (Rajudev) We can translate the documentations too.
  - (ayan) instead of taking live sessions. take pre recorded sessions (premiere?)
  - (manav + Rajudev) We can tell people to contribute to ILUGD's members project.
  - TODO (ayan) put a message on ILUGD channel stating "Add your opensource project into
    a list. And add Good first issue in those repos.". We can ask them to showcase
    their projects and explaining it to others.
  - (aaryan) AMA related to opensource contribution.
    - (ayan) we can ask the interested ones to join friday's community call. we can
      have an AMA on that day.


## Next Call :
  1. Discuss on how we will take cktpy/git/hacktoberfest premier sessions on YT
  2.
