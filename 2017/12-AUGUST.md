Hello Everyone,

At our last to last meet-up on 29th July during which we celebrated
Debian stretch release party we thought it was our best meet-up so
far. But today it felt that this meet up was even better than the last
and we hope our next meet-up will supersede this one and so forth.

The meetup was hosted at a central location accessible by everyone at
Innov8 Co-working Space, Connaught Place which is at the vicinity of
Rajiv Chowk metro station.
The meet-up kicked off with introduction to ILUG-D as there were lots
of first timers followed with introduction of audience. The volunteers
have collected the stats related to the audience and would be shared
soon with everyone.

First talk of the day was a very lighthearted one by our own Manas
kashyap, who is a budding superstar. He talked about his experiences
with free and open source software.

Curiosity of people started rising up during the second talk where our
host from innov8 Saurabh Shandilya talked about TOR, more specifically
problems related to it. This talk was very thought provoking, as the
speaker kept throwing at us with lots of questions. The audience was
very actively participating by pestering the speaker with more
questions because as they say tit-for-tat.

Break for snacks.

The second half consisted of two hands-on sessions. One was
introductory session on Arduino and raspberry pi. Shashank (banana)
headed this one, where he talked how various things worked with the
arduinos's and microcontrollers.

The second one was a very informal session The next session was an
informal Hackathon on Single Board computers conducted conceptualised
by Raju Devidas and co-ordinated by the ILUGD team. The
workshop/hackathon required people to be divided into groups of 8.
Each group had an SBC(single board computers), typically a Raspberry
Pi 2/3 and were given a couple of tasks to be performed. The tasks
were quite simple and required everyone to run a simple web server
which produces a page that everyone connected to local network should
be able to see. Easy? No, the participants beg to differ. The
participants had to connect to the local network that was created by a
router we brought in. This resulted in people devising various
techniques to solve a problem that crept in while solving another one
like some boards didn't have wireless connection so they couldn't
connect to the network, another board didn't have internet connection
to download a web server and so forth. Each team achieved the end
result by pure problem solving skills. One of the fastest teams didn't
have wireless connection on board, so they passed the traffic from
their laptops to the Ethernet port which was connected to the SBC
(single board computer). It was a fun exercise for everyone.

The meetup was concluded after hiring and pitching sessions and
general feedback from the audience.
